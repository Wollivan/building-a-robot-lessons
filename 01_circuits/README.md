# Circuits - Electricity flowing, series and parallel

## Overview

Before we can create anything that uses electricity , first we need to understand how electricity works!
We are going to learn how circuits work, the building blocks of every electronic thing we use, and make some circuits ourselves!

- What do you already know about circuits?
- Do you know what series and paralel mean?
- What do you need for every circuit to work?

## Plan
- Learn how electricity flows, in one direction, in a complete circuit.
- Learn about switches, and how we can stop circuits on purpose.
- Learn about the differences between series and paralel circuits.
- Workshop to see if we can figure out what will happen to a circuit is we change specific things about it.

## Topics
- Currents 
- Power
- Switches
- Elements (light bulbs, buzzers etc)
- Series/Paralel circuits 

## Workshop

Can you create a series circuit that powers a lightbulb?

Can you create a series circuit that powers a lightbulb when a switch it turned on?

Can you create a circuit that powers two lightbulbs?

What happens when you take one of the lightbulb out of the holder?

Can you fix the circuit so that when you remove one lightbulb, the other still shines?

Conclusion 
What do you know about circuits?
What is the difference between series and paralel?
What do you need for every circuit to work? (Power)
